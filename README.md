# EditorOnlyUtils
A collection of tools to extend the Unity editor functionality.

This package avoids runtime extensions to allow you to avoid committing to it as a dependency for your project. Import it when you need it, delete it when you're done, and there should be no effect on your codebase, just improvements to your workflow.


Add to your project with the Package Manager using the git url:
https://github.com/petemainardi/EditorOnlyUtils.git

Or by adding the following to your project's Packages/manifest.json file:
<blockquote>
	<p>"com.editoronly.utils": "https://github.com/petemainardi/EditorOnlyUtils.git"</p>
</blockquote>
